# To-Do-List-Application
This to-do list application allows users to create and manage multiple lists of tasks. 
The main list is where users can add and view all of their tasks. 
In addition, users can create custom lists by simply adding the name of the list to the URL, which allows them to create and manage specific sets of tasks. 
With this application, users can easily organize and keep track of all their to-do items in a convenient and customizable way.
A better version will be coming soon
